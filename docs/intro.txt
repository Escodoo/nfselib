Introduction
==============

nfselib helps to process XML instance documents that obey the
nfse XML schema.

With nfselib (nfselib.py) you can write
Python code to:

- Parse an XML document that obeys the nfse XML schema,
  creating instances of the Python classes that represent the types
  defined in the nfse schema.  These Python classes are
  defined in nfselib.py.

- Create instances of classes that represent the types described in
  the nfse XML schema.

- Write Python application code that uses the classes that
  represent nfse types.

- Export the objects to an XML document.


Schemas
---------

The nfselib.py module in this package was generated from the
XML schemas in ./schemas.


generateDS.py
---------------

The nfselib.py module in this package was generated by
generateDS.py.  You can learn about generateDS.py here:
